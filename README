DataWarehouse
===================

This is incomplete. I'm using it in a production app, but I wouldn't say it's ready to be used by anybody else.

TODO
=======

- Clean up the DB hook stuff.
- Any models in parent_models use the parent DB
- Any models in models use the child DB
- Bring in subproject's bundle gems, and any plugins it relies on
